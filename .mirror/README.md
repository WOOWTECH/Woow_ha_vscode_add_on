# `.mirror/` — mirror operations

Everything here is WOOWTECH-added, not from upstream. Do not delete these
files or the automation will break.

## Files

- **`config.env`** — sourced by workflows. Holds `UPSTREAM_URL`,
  `UPSTREAM_BRANCH`, `MIRROR_IMAGE_PREFIX` and `KEEP_SUBDIRS`.
- **`patch-image.py`** — rewrites `image:` fields in every add-on config so
  HAOS pulls from `ghcr.io/woowtech/ha-mirror-*` instead of upstream ghcr.
  Also emits `image-map.json`.
- **`image-map.json`** — machine-readable list of `(upstream image, arches,
  version, mirror image)` tuples. Consumed by `.github/workflows/image-mirror.yml`.
- **`last-sync.yaml`** — timestamp + upstream commit of the last successful
  mirror-sync run.

## `KEEP_SUBDIRS` — why this mirror prunes

Upstream (`hassio-addons/repository`) publishes more add-ons than we
republish. `mirror-sync` therefore rebuilds `main` from upstream and then
drops every top-level path not listed in `KEEP_SUBDIRS`:

```
KEEP_SUBDIRS="vscode LICENSE.md"
```

The `upstream` branch is a **complete, unpruned** mirror of
`hassio-addons/repository`, so nothing is lost — if we later decide to
republish another add-on, add its directory to `KEEP_SUBDIRS` and re-run the
workflow. If a listed path disappears upstream (rename/removal), mirror-sync
fails loudly instead of publishing an empty store.

The Music Assistant and Matter Hub mirrors do not set `KEEP_SUBDIRS`; their
upstreams are single-product stores where the whole tree is wanted.

## Image naming

Sanitizer: `lowercase; '/' → '-'; '.' → '-'`

| Upstream image | Mirror image |
|----------------|--------------|
| `ghcr.io/hassio-addons/vscode/{arch}` | `ghcr.io/woowtech/ha-mirror-ghcr-io-hassio-addons-vscode-{arch}` |

For an `image:` ending in `/{arch}`, HAOS Supervisor substitutes the arch and
appends `:<version>`; `image-mirror.yml` copies each arch separately. For a
plain image (a multi-arch OCI index), one `skopeo copy --all` carries every
arch.

## Verifying a sync

```bash
gh run list --workflow mirror-sync  --limit 3
gh run list --workflow image-mirror --limit 3
cat .mirror/last-sync.yaml
```

Both workflows can be run manually from the Actions tab (`Run workflow`).
